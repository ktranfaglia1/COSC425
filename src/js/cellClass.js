Authors: Dustin O'Brien
Class: cell
Functions: Constructor that takes in height, width, X Location and Y Location of top corner, and color.
drawCell which draws in individual cell to the canvas and takes ctx as parameter.
insideCell which takes in mouse position to determine if the mouse in inside of a cell.
setColor which sets a new color for the cell that takes new color as parameter.
flipColor swaps a cell visually from dead to alive and vice versa
getColor is an accessor for cell color.
